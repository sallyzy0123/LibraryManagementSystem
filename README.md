This project is a Library Management System developed in Swing JAVA and MySQL. It allows users to manage the book inventory and staff info by fetching, adding, and deleting the data with Java database connectivity(JDBC).<br />
This project is inspired by the 'Find Project' channel on YouTube for study and practice purposes which motivated me to study Java.
